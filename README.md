### SUCH A SILLY FLOWLAUNCHER PLUGIN

**Frustratingly Familiar Favicon Fetcher**

A simple FlowLauncher plugin that uses Google's API to fetch favicons for the domain you enter. But it does so in a frustratingly familiar way.

Install and use as any other FlowLauncher plugin and set its trigger expression (default is `'favi`).

Enter a domain name, and the plugin will try to fetch the favicon and make it available in 3 forms:
1. **Favicon URL**: The direct link to the favicon.
2. **Favicon Image**: The actual image of the favicon.
3. **Favicon Base64**: The favicon image encoded in Base64 format.

Easy.

Theoretically, if I ever find the motivation, I could try adding more favicon APIs. But not now.
